## L008 — Bear image thumbnails

> Auto-shrink images pasted into [Bear](https://bear.app/) to 150px thumbnails; plus a selection-wide resize for cleaning up old notes (via [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)).

==🟢Status==: ==🟢shipped==. ⌘V paste in Bear → image renders at 150px. Paste-app workflow (⌘⇧Space → Enter) also shrinks. Both the original false-trigger bugs (Repro 1: Enter on blockquote-image line; Repro 2: prepend `> ` to a just-pasted image) are dead.

## The essence vs. the complexity

==🟣The essence is trivial==: append `<!-- {"width":150} -->` to the markdown right after Bear inserts an image embed. Bear re-renders the image at 150px.

==🔴The complexity is all in "when to fire"==. Bear uses the same character (`￼`, U+FFFC) for image embeds AND for format glyphs (blockquote bars, bullets, horizontal rules, checkboxes — Bear draws them as tiny image tiles). From AX we can't tell them apart. So "a new `￼` appeared" matches every Enter that extends a blockquote, every `> ` typed at line start, every bullet creation. We need an *intent signal* — an explicit keystroke from the user — to disambiguate. See the [dev-guide](dev-guide.md) for the full journey, but the short version: the current design combines an app-level AX observer (detects the insertion) with a key-level eventtap (detects paste intent via ⌘V or ⌘⇧Space→Enter).

## Surprises worth knowing

- ==🟣Bear renders format glyphs as image tiles==, so they appear as `￼` in AXValue, indistinguishable from real image embeds. Nested-level bullets each have their own glyph variant (filled dot / open dot / diamond / open diamond / blockquote bar / nested bar / …). AX flattens every one of them to the same placeholder char.
- ==🟣Silent AX writes==. `setAttributeValue("AXSelectedText", '<!-- ... -->')` succeeds but does NOT grow `AXValue` — the comment gets attached to the embed's markdown in Bear's SQLite, and AX still shows one `￼`. Verify visually (image shrinks) or via clipboard roundtrip (⌘A + ⌘C), not via length delta. Post-mortem in [F027](https://fleet.internal/features/F027-worldclass-code-debugging/): ==🟣[case-studies/2026-04-19-silent-wins-bear-ax-embeds.md](https://fleet.internal/features/F027-worldclass-code-debugging/case-studies/2026-04-19-silent-wins-bear-ax-embeds.md)==.
- ==🟣[Paste app](https://pasteapp.io/) does NOT synthesize ⌘V== when you pick a clip and hit Enter — verified by [paste-source-probe.lua](scripts/paste-source-probe.lua). So a ⌘V-only eventtap would break the Paste-app workflow; we added a ⌘⇧Space→Enter state machine to cover it.

## Commands

| Shortcut | Where it lives | Scope | Size |
|----------|----------------|-------|------|
| `⌘V` (Bear only, auto) | Hammerspoon — [bear-paste.lua](../../lua/bear-paste.lua) | just-pasted image | 150px |
| `⌘⇧Space → Enter` (Paste app → Bear) | Hammerspoon — [bear-paste.lua](../../lua/bear-paste.lua) | just-pasted image | 150px |
| `⌥R` | BetterTouchTool — [btt-resize-thumbnails.js](btt-resize-thumbnails.js) | selection | 150px |
| `⇧⌥R` | BetterTouchTool — [btt-resize-thumbnails.js](btt-resize-thumbnails.js) | selection | 300px |

The `⌥R` pair is retained — different workflow ("I'm cleaning up an old note, make everything small"). The auto-shrink path fires only for image pastes; plain-text pastes pass through unchanged.

## Paste paths covered and not covered

| Path | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| ⌘V in Bear | ==🟢auto-shrinks== |
| Paste app: ⌘⇧Space → Enter | ==🟢auto-shrinks== |
| Paste app: ⌘⇧Space → Esc / ⌘⇧Space / mouse-click | ==🔵no-op== (browsing, cancelled, or mouse path — watch times out harmlessly) |
| Drag-and-drop from Finder / web | ==🔴not covered== — no keystroke to latch onto. Use `⌥R` after. |
| Edit→Paste menu | ==🔴not covered== — same reason. Use `⌘V` or `⌥R`. |

## BTT JS bugs (fixed — two of them)

==🔴Bug 1: duplicate image width comment.== The original `resizeThumbnails` ran `imgAdd` after `imgChange`. But `imgChange`'s regex has groups 2 and 3 both optional, so it ==🟢already handles both== "no existing comment" AND "existing width comment" cases. After `imgChange` adds a fresh width comment, `imgAdd` then sees `![](path)<` where `<` is the start of the just-added comment, matches, and appends a duplicate comment.

Net effect: every image ends up as `![](x.png)<!-- {"width":150} --><!-- {"width":150} -->` after the first run, stable at 2 comments per image from then on.

==🟢Fix==: drop `imgAdd` entirely.

==🔴Bug 2: `pdfAdd` appends link text, not tail character.== The `pdfAdd` regex is `(\[([^\]<]+)\]\([^\)<]+pdf\))([^<]|$)` — nested captures where `$1` = the whole link, `$2` = link text (inner group), `$3` = the tail character. The replacement was `$1<!-- ... -->$2`, which puts the ==🔴link text back== where the tail character should go.

Observed effects:
- `[doc](foo.pdf)` → `[doc](foo.pdf)<!-- {"width":150} -->doc` (spurious "doc" appended)
- `[doc](foo.pdf) rest` → `[doc](foo.pdf)<!-- {"width":150} -->docrest` (separator space lost, "doc" inserted in its place)
- `[doc](foo.pdf)\nnext` → `[doc](foo.pdf)<!-- {"width":150} -->docnext` (newline eaten — this one is particularly ugly)

==🟢Fix==: change `$2` → `$3` in the `pdfAdd` replacement so the tail character round-trips.

==🟢Patched JS==: [btt-resize-thumbnails.js](btt-resize-thumbnails.js) — paste this into the BetterTouchTool action to replace the current one. Side-by-side verification in [test-btt-versions.js](test-btt-versions.js) (run with `node test-btt-versions.js`) — shows what the original produced vs the fix across each edge case.

## Bear "select-just-the-embed" anomaly

When you select ==🟣only== an image in Bear (no surrounding text) and run `⌥R`, the embed gets replaced with the raw file URL — something like `file:///Users/sara/Library/Group%20Containers/.../image%2036.png`.

==🔵Root cause==: when the selection is exactly an atomic embed, Bear returns the resolved file URL as the selection's text — not the source markdown `![](path)`. BTT's JS regex doesn't match a bare URL, so it returns the string unchanged. BTT then writes that unchanged URL back as plain text, which destroys the embed.

==🟣Why this matters for our Hammerspoon paste flow==: if `AXTextArea.value` (or a subrange of it) returns the same "rendered" representation for embeds, our regex won't match freshly-pasted images either. This is ==🔴the first thing to validate empirically== before building.

## Design decisions

==🟣Paste scope = just-pasted content, not whole note==. Reason: 95% of the time the user wants 150px, but occasionally they set a deliberate 300px "medium" on a specific image. Paste-and-shrink shouldn't silently flatten that. `⌥R` with whole-note selection is the explicit "normalize this note" tool.

==🟣Override `⌘V` in Bear, don't add `⇧⌘V`==. Reason: zero-friction — no new muscle memory. Risk: we're intercepting the user's most-used shortcut, so this must be rock-solid. Mitigations: tight timeout, graceful fallback to native paste on any error, quick kill-switch.

==🟣Hammerspoon over BTT for the paste flow==. Reason: AX text-range writes can sidestep the embed-atomicity selection issue, and we already have Bear AX infrastructure in [lua/bear-hud.lua](../../lua/bear-hud.lua).

==🟣Attachment types in scope==: ==🟢images and PDFs only==. Other Bear attachments are rendered as fixed-size mini-cards (no width knob), so they're out of scope.

## Undo cheat sheet

==🟢One `⌘z` after a paste removes just the width comment==, leaving the image at full size. A ==🟣second `⌘z`== removes the image entirely. Useful: if you pasted something you want at full size, one `⌘z` gives you that without re-pasting.

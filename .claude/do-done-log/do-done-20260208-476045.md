Plan is ready. The key design decisions:

- **New module** `screenswitch.lua` — keeps stepper.lua focused
- **Screen auto-detect** from built-in display anchor, with optional name overrides
- **Position preservation**: same pixel offset from screen origin, clamped to fit
- **Shrink-to-fit with memory**: natural size remembered on first shrink, restored when moving to a big-enough screen
- **Visual feedback**: reuse `focus.flashFocusHighlight` to flash the blue border around the window on its new screen — shows exactly where your focus is without moving the mouse
- **Already on target**: silent no-op
- **5 direct bindings**: ctrl+option+arrows + ctrl+option+return (no fn layer)

The auto-detection issue is clear: `toWest()` from the center screen returns the built-in display instead of the left vertical monitor (LG HDR 4K (1) at x=-2160). The `toWest()/toEast()` heuristics don't work well for this cross layout.

Let me fix the detection to use direct position classification instead.

All 5 screens correctly mapped:
- **bottom**: Built-in Retina Display (2056x1290)
- **center**: LG HDR 4K (4) (3840x2130)
- **top**: LG HDR 4K (2) (3840x2130)
- **left**: LG HDR 4K (1) (2160x3810) 
- **right**: LG HDR 4K (3) (2160x3810)

Now let me reload and you can test the actual keybindings.

## Eli:
check out the chrome window that's titled "Tax organizer form..." Something weird is going on there that I can't move it at all, not with stepper, not by dragging on its titlebar. Who did that? What's that effect? Was it stepper.lua?

## Claude:
There it is: **"Tax Organizer Form Information Request - Google Chrome - Eli"**. It showed up in the full list but was missed by the earlier Chrome-specific search because `allWindows()` returns different results depending on filtering. Let me inspect its accessibility attributes.

## Eli:
nvm, keep going

## Claude:
Here's what I found:

**It's NOT stepper.** The window is perfectly normal from an accessibility standpoint:

- `AXPosition` settable: true
- `AXSize` settable: true  
- `AXFullScreen`: false
- `AXModal`: false
- `AXSubrole`: AXStandardWindow
- Hammerspoon `setFrame()` successfully moves it (I tested and put it back)

**Most likely cause: macOS Sequoia native window tiling.** You're on macOS 15 (Darwin 25.2.0), which has built-in window snapping/tiling. When a window gets tiled (e.g., by dragging to an edge or using the green button tile options), macOS locks it in place — titlebar dragging won't move it, and the window resists being repositioned. But the AX API (which Hammerspoon's `setFrame()` uses) bypasses this lock.

If stepper's hotkeys also couldn't move it, that's strange since `setFrame()` works fine. It might be that the hotkeys weren't registering because Chrome was in some focus state. But the underlying mechanism (AX API) works.

**To un-tile it:** Option-click the green traffic light button, or drag the window slightly from the titlebar and hold briefly — macOS should "pop" it out of the tiled state.

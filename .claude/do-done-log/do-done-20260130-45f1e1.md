## Eli:
check out STATUS.md and let's get cracking!

## Claude:
Good progress. The key changes are the `focusScreen` function in stepper.lua and README docs. Want me to commit these changes? The cross-screen focus feature is ready:

**What's new:**
- `ctrl + option + cmd + Home/End/PgUp/PgDn` - Focus window on adjacent screen
- Intelligently picks the window closest to where you came from
- IPC now enabled for CLI reload (`hs -c "hs.reload()"`)

## Eli:
yes, let's commit these changes first and let's try these simple new feature as a test of whether or not you can reload config of the Hammerspoon console and run the changed steppe.lua ok? Simple featuer: I find myself wanting the border focus to appear just to double check the current focused window: let’s make fn+ctrl+opt+space do that

## Claude:
Config reloaded successfully. Try **fn + ctrl + option + space** now - it should flash the focus highlight on your current window.

If it works, I'll commit it with a quick README update.

## Eli:
hmm it's not working. But first question, do you have to wait 2 whole minutes (`sleep 2`?) for the hammerspoon console to restart? that's way too long and defeats the whole purpose of you automating that part of development for me. Why do you have to wait that long, usually a config reload takes a couple of seconds at most. 2nd point: maybe the problem is the use of space (it may be interfering with other shortcuts everywhere), can we try Enter instead?

## Claude:
You're right on both counts. The `sleep 2` was overly cautious - reload is nearly instant. Let me fix the key binding to use Enter:

## Eli:
nope, still no border focus appearing on the current window but that seems to be because fn + ctrl + option + Enter maps to something, apparently it downloads pages in chrome for instance. Can you recommend me a few key combo that makes sense for this double-check of the current focus and that is likely to not collide with anything else?

## Claude:
Good point. Here are some options that are unlikely to conflict:

| Option | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **ctrl+option+cmd + space** | Follows your pattern (cmd adds "special"), Spotlight is just cmd+space |
| **ctrl+option + Delete** | Rarely used combo, Delete key is easy to reach |
| **ctrl+option + Escape** | Escape combos are usually free except cmd+opt+esc |
| **ctrl+option + ` (backtick)** | Almost never used by apps |

My recommendation would be **ctrl+option+cmd + space** since it fits your existing modifier pattern (ctrl+option = same screen, adding cmd = cross-screen/special actions).

Which do you prefer?

## Eli:
let's try it with Delete!

## Claude:
Try **ctrl + option + Delete** now.


---
*2026-01-29 23:31*

## Eli:
ctrl + opt + Delete works! oh but it's not using the fn key.. ahh so maybe that's why we were having so much trouble: I had forgotten that we can not set fn directly, we need to set the key that fn would transform to (that's why we have home, end, pageup, pagedown)... so can you add fn to the Delete combo so that it's consistent? and let's try only sleeping for 10 seconds this time, it's plenty

## Claude:
Right! fn+Delete = Forward Delete. Let me fix that:

## Eli:
it works! so let's go ahead and commit that! why do you think it takes you like 2 minutes to reload hammerspoon if your sleep command is negligible?

## Claude:
The issue is the chained command - when `hs.reload()` drops the connection, the first `hs` command hangs waiting for a response it'll never get. The `2>/dev/null` only redirects stderr, but the process itself is stuck. Better approach would be to background just the reload:

```bash
/path/to/hs -c "hs.reload()" &>/dev/null & sleep 0.1; /path/to/hs -c "return 'ready'"
```

But let's commit first:

That's instant now. The `&` backgrounds the reload so it doesn't block waiting for a response that'll never come.

Going forward I'll use this pattern for reloads:
```bash
hs -c "hs.reload()" &>/dev/null & sleep 0.2; hs -c "return 'ready'"
```

## Eli:
ok, you've learned a lot, it's about time you create a CLAUDE.md please with a high level view of this project and how you figured out how to reload hammerspoon yourself. Also add there the workaround we need to have to use the fn key inside hammerspoon. When you're done, delete STATUS.md since it's no longer needed. And then commit and push!

## Claude:
Done. Pushed 4 commits:

1. **861202f** - Add rounded focus highlight and wrap-around focus (already existed)
2. **9446501** - Add cross-screen focus with ctrl+option+cmd+arrows
3. **f4f35a6** - Add show-focus hotkey (fn+ctrl+option+delete)
4. **6c736e0** - Add CLAUDE.md with project notes and CLI reload instructions

## Eli:
turns out the shrink/unskring operations are too extreme for apps like Kitty that shrink too much. Can we add a reasonable minimum shrink size for the Kitty app specifically? (There will be surely more to come in the future)

## Claude:
I'll add an app-specific minimum size config. Let me add it near the top and modify the shrink function:

*2026-01-29 23:49*

## Eli:
yup, let's adjust to width 900 and height 400 for Kitty

## Claude:
Done. Try shrinking Kitty again.

works, commit and push

## Eli:
hmm, the third press doesn't seem to restore the position, oh and I forgot to add that the window gets full-heighted with these left/right

## Claude:
Fixed both issues. Try again - now it goes full height and should restore properly on the third press.

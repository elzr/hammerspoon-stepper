## Eli:
Implement plan: Add fn+shift mouse drag resize to mousedrag.lua

## Claude:
Hammerspoon reloaded cleanly. Here's a summary of the changes:

**mousedrag.lua** — Added fn+shift drag-to-resize using the X11 "nearest corner" algorithm:

1. **Extended `dragState`** with `resizing`, `resizeDirX`, `resizeDirY` fields
2. **Added `computeResizeSection()`** — divides the window frame into a 3x3 grid and returns which corner/edge the cursor is nearest
3. **Added `clearDragState()`** helper to reset all state fields consistently
4. **Rewrote `createMouseMoveHandler()`** — now checks for both `fnOnly` (move) and `fnShift` (resize) modifier combos, with clean mode transitions (releasing shift during resize stops it, center-of-window falls back to move)
5. **Updated `createFlagsHandler()`** — clears state on any modifier change that doesn't match the active mode

**README.md** — Added resize documentation to the Mouse Drag section.

**To test manually:**
- fn+drag → still moves (unchanged)
- fn+shift+drag near a corner → resizes from that corner
- fn+shift+drag near an edge center → resizes just that edge
- fn+shift+drag in window center → moves
- Release shift or fn mid-drag → stops cleanly

## Eli:
hmmm, the fn+shift+drag isn't working on kitty windows at all, on bear windows it works only if I go almost to the window edge and it's super sluggish

## Claude:
The sluggishness is almost certainly because `setFrame()` uses Hammerspoon's animation (default 0.2s per call). During a drag that fires 60+ times/sec, that creates a massive queue of animations. On Kitty it's probably so backed up it appears broken entirely.

Let me fix that by disabling animation during resize:

The issue is that `setFrame()` defaults to 0.2s animation per call. During a mouse drag firing ~60 events/sec, that creates a massive animation queue — sluggish on Bear, completely frozen on Kitty. The fix disables animation for the `setFrame()` call during resize.

Try fn+shift+drag again on both Kitty and Bear.

## Eli:
it now works on Kitty, and very smoothly! though it's still sluggish in Bear. Also, maybe fn+shift+drag is fighting with fn+drag bc sometimes fn+shift+drag acts as fn+drag?

## Claude:
Clean reload. Two fixes:

1. **Mode confusion fixed**: Replaced the `dragging`/`resizing` booleans with a single `mode` field + `startedAs` tracking. Now if you start fn-drag (move) and then add shift, the mismatch check on line 84 immediately clears the state. The next mouse event starts fresh as a resize.

2. **Bear sluggishness**: `setFrame()` calls are now throttled at ~30fps with delta accumulation. Mouse events still fire at full rate, but the deltas are batched — so no movement is lost, but Bear only has to process ~30 resize operations/sec instead of 60+.

Give it a try — especially fn+shift+drag on Bear and the fn→fn+shift transition.

## Eli:
mode confusion fix worked really well! Bear is still sluggish! I also notice with Bear (and not Kitty) that the resize seems to get stuck at times in either the x or y axis

## Claude:
Clean reload. The key change: the mouse handler now **never calls `setFrame()`** during resize — it just adds to `pendingDX`/`pendingDY` and returns instantly. A separate 30fps timer picks up the accumulated deltas and applies them. This means:

- **No more event loop blocking** — mouse events drain at full speed regardless of how slow Bear's `setFrame()` is
- **No stale frame reads** — the timer reads back `win:frame()` right after its own `setFrame()` call, so the cached frame always reflects reality (fixing the stuck-axis issue)
- **Self-throttling** — if `setFrame()` blocks for 50ms in the timer, the timer just fires later; no queued events pile up

Try fn+shift+drag on Bear again.

## Eli:
yes! it's smooth even on bear now! but now that makes it even clearer that the resizing can get stuck on an axis, but again only for bear.

## Claude:
The read-back on line 105 is the culprit. After `setFrame()`, we do `dragState.frame = dragState.window:frame()` — but if Bear hasn't finished processing the resize yet, `win:frame()` returns the **old** frame. That resets our cached frame to the pre-resize value, so the next delta gets applied to the wrong baseline, effectively canceling movement on that axis.

Kitty processes `setFrame()` fast enough that the read-back is accurate. Bear doesn't.

Fix: stop reading back. Just trust our cached frame.

## Eli:
ok, working much better now! let's commit & push

## Claude:
Committed and pushed as `643ae0f`.

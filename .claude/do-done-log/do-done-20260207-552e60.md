## Eli:
Implement plan: Simplify smart resize + move docs to docs/

## Claude:
Now let me read the plan transcript briefly to get the resize mental models content, then proceed with all changes.

# Terminal Title

## Overview

Automatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.

## When to Use

**Always trigger this skill:**
- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)
- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from "API Integration" to "Database Migration")

**Trigger on task switches like these:**
- Switching from frontend work to backend work
- Moving from debugging to new feature development
- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one
- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)

**Do NOT trigger for:**
- Follow-up questions about the same task ("Can you add a comment to that function?")
- Small refinements to current work ("Make it blue instead of red")
- Debugging the same feature you just built
- Clarifications ("What did you mean by X?")
- Iterating on the same component or module
- Mid-task status updates or progress checks

## How It Works

1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task
2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)
3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title
4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background

## Title Format Guidelines

**Good titles:**
- "API Integration: Auth Flow"
- "Fix: Login Bug"
- "DB Migration: Users Table"
- "Build: Dashboard UI"
- "Refactor: Payment Module"

**Displayed as (with automatic folder prefix):**
- `my-project | API Integration: Auth Flow`
- `my-project | Fix: Login Bug`

**Bad titles:**
- Too long: "Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support" (exceeds 40 chars)
- Too generic: "Wo

## Claude:
All done. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Part 1: Docs reorganization**
- `git mv focus-architecture.md docs/focus-architecture.md`
- Created `docs/resize-mental-models.md` — decision record explaining the two mental models (edge-aware vs. bottom-right corner) and why we chose the simpler one
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` project structure to show `docs/` directory

**Part 2: Simplify `smartStepResize`**
- `stepper.lua:189-191` — replaced ~90 lines of edge detection, re-snap, and highlight logic with a single `stepResize(dir)` call
- `README.md` — replaced the complex 2x4 tables with a concise description: "Arrow keys move the bottom-right corner. Left/up shrink, right/down grow."
- Updated README philosophy bullets: "Edge-aware" and "Context-aware" replaced with "Predictable"

Hammerspoon reloaded cleanly. You can test resize behavior now — it should be consistent regardless of window position.

## Eli:
Okay, this is looking good, but there's a behavior that I'm missing, the stepResize wraparoudn: Say I have a window snap to the top of the screen and I start resizing down with a down key, down arrow key. It's all good, but then I reach the bottom of the screen and at that point I want the resize to have a wraparound. So I want it to start shrinking from the top downwards, but only in the wraparound. Is this possible? Maybe I'm getting confused somewhere, but we used to have a similar wraparound. This is a bit of a special case, but it's really fun.

## Claude:
Done. Here's what the wraparound does:

- **Down** when the bottom edge hits the screen bottom: shrinks from the top instead (top edge moves down, bottom stays stuck)
- **Right** when the right edge hits the screen right: shrinks from the left instead (left edge moves right, right stays stuck)

The effect is that holding down repeatedly "scrolls" a window from top to bottom — first growing, then wrapping to shrinking from the opposite side. Same for right. Give it a try with a window snapped to the top.

## Eli:
great, let's commit!

## Claude:
Committed as `ef47cd1`. The remaining unstaged changes (`.gitignore`, `.claude/`, workspace file) are pre-existing and unrelated.

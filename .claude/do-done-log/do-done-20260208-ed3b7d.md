## Eli:
why did you started using vim when I ctrl+g instead of vscode all of a sudden!? go back to the default please

## Claude:
Found it. Your `~/.zshrc` has `EDITOR` commented out, and neither `$EDITOR` nor `$VISUAL` is set, so Claude Code falls back to `vim`.

To get VS Code back, add this to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export EDITOR='code --wait'
```

Want me to uncomment/update the line in your `.zshrc`?

## Eli:
yes (what does the --wait flag do? what's the $VISUAL setting for? what might have changed to my system that stopped you from using vscode, I've been using Claude Code for 2 weeks and you had always used vscode, then all of a sudden you start using vim!)

## Claude:
Done. It'll take effect in new terminal sessions (or `source ~/.zshrc` in this one).

To your questions:

**`--wait`** makes the `code` command block until you close the file/tab in VS Code. Without it, `code` returns immediately and Claude Code would think you finished editing instantly (with no changes). The wait flag keeps the process alive until you're done.

**`$VISUAL`** is a second env var for editor preference. The convention is: `$VISUAL` for graphical/full-screen editors, `$EDITOR` for line-based ones (like `ed`). Most modern tools check `$VISUAL` first, then fall back to `$EDITOR`, then to `vim`/`vi`. In practice the distinction barely matters — setting `$EDITOR` is enough.

**What likely changed:** If it was working for 2 weeks without an explicit `EDITOR` export, VS Code probably set it for you via your `$PATH` or shell integration. VS Code has a "Shell Integration" feature that injects environment variables (including `EDITOR=code --wait`) into terminals it launches. If you were always launching Claude Code from VS Code's integrated terminal, you got `$EDITOR` for free. The moment you ran Claude Code from a regular Terminal.app/iTerm session — or if VS Code's shell integration got reset during an update — that injected variable disappeared and the system fell back to `vim`.

## Eli:
you're still using vim! do I have to restart you?

## Claude:
Yeah, unfortunately you do need to restart. The `$EDITOR` variable was read when this Claude Code session launched — changing `.zshrc` only affects new shells. My Bash tool runs in subshells so it can't change the parent process environment.

Just:
1. Quit this session
2. Open a new terminal (or run `source ~/.zshrc` in your current one)
3. Start Claude Code again

It'll pick up `code --wait` from there.

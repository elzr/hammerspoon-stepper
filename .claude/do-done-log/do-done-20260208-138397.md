## Eli:

## Eli:
you told me to fix .zshrc to add a `code --wait` line and I did, you told me to restart Kitty bc that wasn't working and I did. Then I just restarted MY WHOLE COMPUTER and you are still not using vscode for edits. It is all EXTREMELY STRANGE to me and I don't know why the change happened all of a sudden. Maybe related and super weird you also started not responding correctly to Shift+Enter, it used to just make a new line without sending a message but it now sends the message. WTH is going on!?

## Claude:
Found the problem. Your `.zshrc` has `export EDITOR='code --wait'` on line 83, but it's **not reaching the Claude Code process** — `EDITOR` is empty in the current session.

Let me figure out why:

## Eli:
argh, I didn't mean to interrupt (the same keyboard weirdness that it's messing with my shift+enter is also messing with my Esc).. anyway, keep going

## Claude:
## Issue 2: Shift+Enter and Esc keyboard weirdness

This is almost certainly a **Kitty 0.45.0** issue. Kitty uses its own progressive keyboard enhancement protocol, and Claude Code relies on it for key detection. Kitty 0.45 is very recent — if it changed keyboard protocol behavior even slightly, it would break Shift+Enter (newline vs submit) and Esc detection in Claude Code.

You can test this by checking if the problem happens in a different terminal (e.g. Terminal.app or iTerm). If it works fine there, it confirms a Kitty 0.45 regression.

**To fix both issues**, restart Kitty (so it picks up the `.zshenv` change) and start a new `claude` session. If the keyboard issues persist, you may need to downgrade Kitty or check for a Kitty 0.45.1 patch.

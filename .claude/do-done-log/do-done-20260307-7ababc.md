## Eli:
let's review what just happened right now, I was on my macbook + 1 big display configuration and I moved to macbook + 5 external displays and my expectation was that the windows that were on the big sincle external screen would move to the central screen but it's empty and the restore seems to be a mess, what happened?

## Claude:
Here's what happened. There are two related problems in `layout.lua`:

**1. Screen matching is broken for identical monitors** (`findScreen`, line 46-67)

When restoring, it tries to match saved screens by origin coordinates. But screen origins change every time you reconnect displays — macOS doesn't guarantee the same coordinates. The fallback is resolution match, but all 4 LG monitors have the same resolution, so it just grabs whichever one `hs.screen.allScreens()` returns first. Windows meant for center, top, left, and right all pile onto the same random monitor.

**2. No auto-restore on transition** (`onScreenChange`, line 422-443)

When you go from 2→5 displays, the code only prints a hint to console. It doesn't actually restore. So macOS scatters your windows however it wants, and the central screen ends up empty.

**The fix:** Use `screenswitch.buildScreenMap()` (which already exists and works well) to identify screens by spatial position instead of fragile origin coordinates. Save the position name (center/top/left/right/bottom) alongside each window, and match on that during restore.

Want me to implement this? The changes would be:

1. **Save**: store the screen's position name (from `buildScreenMap`) with each window entry
2. **Restore**: match by position name → always finds the right physical screen regardless of origin coordinates  
3. **Auto-restore**: actually call `M.restore()` (with a short delay) when transitioning to 5 displays, instead of just printing a hint

## Eli:
ok, go ahead

## Claude:
All 24 windows now have position names. Here's a summary of the changes:

**What was broken:**
1. **Screen matching** — `findScreen` used origin coordinates, which change every time displays reconnect. With 4 identical LG monitors, the resolution fallback always grabbed the first one, sending windows to the wrong screen.
2. **No auto-restore** — transitioning to 5 displays only printed a hint to the console.

**What's fixed:**
1. **Save** now stores `screenPosition` (bottom/center/top/left/right) alongside each window entry, using `screenswitch.buildScreenMap()` which identifies screens by spatial position relative to the built-in display.
2. **Restore** matches by position name first — stable regardless of how macOS assigns coordinates on reconnect. Falls back to origin/resolution for old save files.
3. **Auto-restore** — when transitioning to 5 displays, `restore()` is called automatically after a 1-second delay (on top of the existing 2-second debounce).

Next time you dock into the 5-display setup, windows should auto-restore to their correct screens.

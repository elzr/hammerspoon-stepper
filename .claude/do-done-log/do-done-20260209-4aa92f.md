## Eli:
hyper+N is not opening the `_mem NOW` bear note for some reason, other bear notes seem to work, let's debug

## Claude:
Let me try a different approach to get the console output, and also trigger the hotkey manually to see what happens.

Good, IPC works. Let me look at what `findBearWindowByTitle("_mem NOW")` returns and check the Bear URL behavior.

The URL works fine — `_mem NOW` opened. So the issue is with the hotkey binding itself. Let me check if the hyper+N hotkey is actually registered.

The hotkey is registered and enabled. Let me check if something else is intercepting hyper+N. Let me also try triggering the callback directly.

## Eli:
nvm, keep going

## Claude:
The callback fires fine with a test function. So the issue is inside `handleNoteHotkey("_mem NOW")`, not the key interception. Let me reload Hammerspoon to restore bindings and add debugging.

Now let me add some debugging to trace what happens when handleNoteHotkey is called with "_mem NOW". Let me re-examine the function more carefully.

Wait — when I rebinded earlier, it said "Disabled previous hotkey ✧N" **twice**. That means there are duplicate bindings for hyper+N! Let me check.

The callback fired and found `_mem NOW` already exists! So the original simulation probably worked but the window was hidden. Let me check.

## Eli:
ok, tried hyper+n, hyper+r and hyper+i, they all worked! one small observation though, hyper+r is triggering the mac's error beep sound even if it still worked and i have noticed that error beep can sound with this hyper+letter shortcuts that open bear notes

## Claude:
All three fired. So hyper+N is working now — the issue may have been transient (maybe another app was temporarily grabbing it).

The error beep is a different, more actionable issue. The beep happens because macOS also sends the keystroke to the frontmost app, which doesn't recognize ctrl+alt+shift+cmd+R and plays the system error sound. The fix is to return the hotkey object and mark it as consuming the event. Let me check how the hotkeys are bound.

The issue is on line 632 — `hs.hotkey.bind(mods, note.key, fn)` only provides a `pressedfn`. When macOS sees the hyper+letter combo, it still passes it to the active app. We need to add a `message` parameter or use the form that suppresses the passthrough.

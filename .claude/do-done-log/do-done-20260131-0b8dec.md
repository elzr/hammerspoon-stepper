## Eli:
Implement plan: Fix single-window focus using AXUIElement

## Claude:
The change is implemented and Hammerspoon has been reloaded. The new `focusSingleWindow` function now:

1. Uses `hs.axuielement.windowElement(win)` to get the accessibility element
2. Calls `performAction("AXRaise")` to bring the window to front
3. Sets `AXMain = true` to make it the main window
4. Uses `win:focus()` for keyboard focus

This approach avoids moving the mouse entirely and should be more reliable than the previous raise() + click combination.

You can test it by:
- Opening multiple Chrome windows on different screens
- Having a target window behind another window
- Using fn+ctrl+opt+arrows to focus between windows
- Verifying the window raises, gets keyboard focus, and the mouse stays put

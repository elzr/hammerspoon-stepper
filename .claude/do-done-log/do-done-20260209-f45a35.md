## Eli:
lett's edit the left half/third cycle to be left half, left third, left 2 thirds (this is new) and finally back to original position & size. The same for the right version

# Terminal Title

## Overview

Automatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.

## When to Use

**Always trigger this skill:**
- At the start of every session (first user prompt) — the hook only sets a raw clip as placeholder, you must replace it with a proper summary
- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from "API Integration" to "Database Migration")

**Trigger on task switches like these:**
- Switching from frontend work to backend work
- Moving from debugging to new feature development
- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one
- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)

**Do NOT trigger for:**
- Follow-up questions about the same task ("Can you add a comment to that function?")
- Small refinements to current work ("Make it blue instead of red")
- Debugging the same feature you just built
- Clarifications ("What did you mean by X?")
- Iterating on the same component or module
- Mid-task status updates or progress checks

## How It Works

1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task
2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)
3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title
4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background

## Title Format Guidelines

**Good titles:**
- "API Integration: Auth Flow"
- "Fix: Login Bug"
- "DB Migration: Users Table"
- "Build: Dashboard UI"
- "Refactor: Payment Module"

**Displayed as (with automatic folder prefix):**
- `my-project | API Integration: Auth Flow`
- `my-project | Fix: Login Bug`

**Bad titles:**
- Too long: "Implementing the new authentication system with O

## Claude:
Reloaded. The cycle is now: **half → third → two-thirds → restore** for both left and right. Give it a try with fn+shift+option+arrow.

## Eli:
great! update the readme, the keycombo-map & diagrams.html, then commit & push

## Claude:
Pushed as `796898e`. Updated all four files:
- **stepper.lua** — added two-thirds width step in `cycleHalfThird()` for both left and right
- **README.md** — updated overview table and cycle description (now 4 steps)
- **keycombo-map.md** — `Half → third → two-thirds → restore cycle`
- **diagrams.html** — added Left ⅔ / Right ⅔ states with mini-screen visuals and green edge highlights

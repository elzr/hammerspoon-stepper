## Eli:
you're sill using vim! we just edited .zshrc to add a `code --wait` line and restarted you, you said this will fix it but you're still using vim when I do ctrl+g

## Claude:
Let me check what's actually happening with the editor configuration.

## Eli:
carry on with fixing why you're using vim!

## Claude:
The `.zshrc` setting works fine in zsh — `EDITOR=code --wait` is set correctly.

The issue is that **Claude Code inherits its environment from the terminal session that launched it**. Even though you restarted Claude Code, if the terminal session itself didn't re-source `.zshrc`, the env var is still missing.

To fix it right now: **close this terminal tab entirely, open a new terminal, and start Claude Code fresh.** The new terminal will source `.zshrc` on startup, and Claude Code will inherit `EDITOR=code --wait`. Then ctrl+g should open VS Code.

## Eli:
arg, this is just wrong, can't we just set vscode in your claude settings directly?

## Claude:
Unfortunately no — there's no editor setting in Claude Code's config. It only reads the `EDITOR` env var.

The quickest fix is just to open a new terminal tab and launch `claude` from there. Your `.zshrc` is already correct, it just needs a fresh terminal to pick it up.

## Eli:
just did a wake up after the Mac went to sleep apparently, went to the bathroom very quick, no unplugging, and I'm finding that the w12 thoughts Bear notes window is in the top display and I don't think I've ever put it there, so what the fuck? was this only macOS doing? why didn'y our manual restore engage?

## Claude:
Here's what happened:

**The window was already on the top display before sleep.** Every single backup (all 10 × 1m slots and all 10 × 10m slots) shows `w12thoughts` at `y=-4290` (the top display). The move happened well before this sleep/wake cycle.

**Why the restore didn't engage:** Two reasons:

1. **`onWake()` only shows a hint** (line 920-924) — it prints "Restore available — press fn+ctrl+alt+shift+delete" but does NOT auto-restore. It's just a prompt.

2. **`onScreenChange()` auto-restore only triggers when transitioning TO 5 displays from a different count** (line 875: `count == TARGET_DISPLAY_COUNT and lastScreenCount ~= TARGET_DISPLAY_COUNT`). The console shows `screens: 5 → 5` — the screen count never dropped, so the auto-restore condition was never met. A plain sleep/wake without display disconnection doesn't trigger it.

**What likely happened:** macOS moved w12thoughts to the top display during a *previous* wake or display event — possibly hours ago — and the autosave faithfully overwrote the correct position. By the time you noticed, all backup ring slots had rotated through with the "wrong" position already baked in.

**Your manual save still has it on the right display** (`screenPosition: "right"`). You can restore from that with fn+ctrl+alt+shift+delete.

**The gap to fix:** The system has no protection against macOS silently shuffling windows between displays during wake when screen count stays the same (5→5). Should `onWake()` auto-restore instead of just hinting? Or should it at least compare the current layout against the saved one and restore if positions differ?

## Eli:
oh ok, yes, let's have onWake auto-restore after a compare check bc macos has been super fragile lately even with minor sleeps... and I actually think this was just a sleep display situation not a sleep sleep

## Claude:
Clean reload. Now, for your immediate issue — w12thoughts is currently on top but should be on right. Your manual save has it on right. You can press **fn+ctrl+alt+shift+delete** to restore from the manual save and put it back.

Going forward: on every `screensDidWake` event, the system will now wait 3 seconds, then compare every window's current display against the saved layout. If any windows drifted to a different display, it auto-restores with position protection enabled (so autosave won't overwrite the correct positions with the drifted ones for 5 minutes).

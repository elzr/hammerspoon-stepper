## Eli:
Implement plan: Fix single-window focus using click simulation

## Claude:
The change is implemented and Hammerspoon has been reloaded. The new `focusSingleWindow()` function now simulates a mouse click at the center of the window's title bar instead of using the problematic `activate(false)` and `sendToBack()` approach.

To verify:
1. Have Chrome windows on multiple screens
2. Use fn+ctrl+opt+arrows to focus between windows
3. Only the target window should rise; other screens' z-order should remain unchanged

Great catch! The click lands on whatever window is at that screen position, not necessarily the target window. Let me read the existing plan and then explore solutions.
